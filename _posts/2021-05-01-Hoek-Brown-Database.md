If you will use Hoek-Brown in your Python code, I have done the manual labour, don't write it all again. A dictionary called `RockDict` is given in the following Gist. Rock types are given as keys of dict and a sub-dictionary with:

* MR: Modulus Ratio
* MRSTD: Modulus Ratio Deviation
* Type: Rock Type (Igneous, Metamorphic, Sedimentary)
* mi: Material Constant
* miSDT: Material Constant Deviation
